/**
 * An RPC client connects to the specified server and allows you to make calls to the server that perform various
 * useful tasks. Please see the Client RPC section of docs.corda.net to learn more about how this API works. A brief
 * description is provided here.
 *
 * Calling [start] returns an [RPCConnection] containing a proxy that lets you invoke RPCs on the server. Calls on
 * it block, and if the server throws an exception then it will be rethrown on the client. Proxies are thread safe and
 * may be used to invoke multiple RPCs in parallel.
 *
 * RPC sends and receives are logged on the net.corda.rpc logger.
 *
 * The [CordaRPCOps] defines what client RPCs are available. If an RPC returns an [rx.Observable] anywhere in the object
 * graph returned then the server-side observable is transparently forwarded to the client side here.
 * *You are expected to use it*. The server will begin sending messages immediately that will be buffered on the
 * client, you are expected to drain by subscribing to the returned observer. You can opt-out of this by simply
 * calling the [net.corda.client.rpc.notUsed] method on it.
 *
 * You don't have to explicitly close the observable if you actually subscribe to it: it will close itself and free up
 * the server-side resources either when the client or JVM itself is shutdown, or when there are no more subscribers to
 * it. Once all the subscribers to a returned observable are unsubscribed or the observable completes successfully or
 * with an error, the observable is closed and you can't then re-subscribe again: you'll have to re-request a fresh
 * observable with another RPC.
 *
 * In case of loss of connection to the server, the client will try to reconnect using the settings provided via
 * [CordaRPCClientConfiguration]. While attempting failover, current and future RPC calls will throw
 * [RPCException] and previously returned observables will call onError().
 *
 * If the client was created using a list of hosts, automatic failover will occur (the servers have to be started in
 * HA mode).
 *
 * @param hostAndPort The network address to connect to.
 * @param configuration An optional configuration used to tweak client behaviour.
 * @param sslConfiguration An optional [ClientRpcSslOptions] used to enable secure communication with the server.
 * @param haAddressPool A list of [NetworkHostAndPort] representing the addresses of servers in HA mode.
 * The client will attempt to connect to a live server by trying each address in the list. If the servers are not in
 * HA mode, the client will round-robin from the beginning of the list and try all servers.
